== What is docs-as-code approach?

"Docs as code" refers to the process of writing documentation using some of the tools that programmers use to manage source code.

* Instead of writing statements in a programming language, writers compose text in a lightweight markup language such as AsciiDoc, Markdown, or reStructuredText.

* Content is managed in a version control system, such as Git or Bitbucket.

* Writers use an issue tracker such as JIRA, to manage tasks and projects.

* Very often, a static site generator, such as Antora, Jekyll, or Hugo, is used to build a website.
