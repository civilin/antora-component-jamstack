JAMstack refers to technologies that generate static web sites using a "stack" of tools, notably JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. The resulting web pages  contains fixed content. The same information is served to every visitor. Performance is generally faster than dynamic websites, which generate HTML pages based on information in databases.
