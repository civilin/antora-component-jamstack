= How to add an article-level TOC

Here's how to add to your Antora site, a TOC of headings in the current page.

If a page has H2 or lower headings, those headings are listed in a sidebar on the right. The sidebar is hidden for narrow media sizes, such as phones.

Thanks to https://canary.gitlab.com/antora/antora.org/issues/20[this list] of sites using Antora, I came across https://across-docs.foreach.be/across-site/preview/across/2.1.2-dev/index.html[Across Platform documentation]. The technique and code below comes from its https://github.com/ForeachOS/ax-docs-across-site-ui[UI bundle]. Many sincere thanks to developers at Across who wrote and shared this wonderful code.

*To add this TOC to your Antora UI:*

== Edit article.hbs

. Edit /src/partials/article.hbs the your UI source.

. Change line 1 from
+
[source, html]
----
<article class="doc">
----
+
to
+
[source, html]
----
<article class="doc"><a name="section-top"></a>
----

. Append these lines to the end of article.hbs:
+
[source, html]
----
<aside class="article-aside hidden" role="navigation">
  <h3 class="toc-title">Contents</h3>
  <div id="article-toc"></div>
</aside>
----

For my site, I changed "Contents" to "On this page:".

== Edit footer-scripts.hbs

. Edit /src/partials/footer-scripts.hbs the your UI source.

. Add code to populate a right-hand sidebar using tocbot.js. For more information about tocbot, see the https://tscanlin.github.io/tocbot/[Tocbot page] on GitHub. I slightly modified this code as shown below, to make it display all heading levels except h1. That hides Tocbot when an article has no subheadings.
+
Your footer-scripts code probably looks similar to:
+
[source,html]
----
<script src="{{uiRootPath}}/js/site.js"></script>
<script src="{{uiRootPath}}/js/vendor/highlight.js"></script>
<script>hljs.initHighlighting()</script>
----

. Replace that with this code from Across UI:
+
[source, html]
----
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tocbot/4.1.1/tocbot.min.js"></script>
<script src="{{uiRootPath}}/js/site.js"></script>
<script src="{{uiRootPath}}/js/vendor/highlight.js"></script>
<script>hljs.initHighlighting()</script>
<script>
  tocbot.init( {
                  tocSelector: '#article-toc',
                  contentSelector: 'article',
                  headingSelector: 'h2, h3, h4, h5, h6',
                  collapseDepth: 6,
                  positionFixedSelector: '#article-toc',
                  scrollSmooth: false
                } );
  var tocList = document.getElementById( 'article-toc' ).getElementsByClassName( 'toc-list' );
  if ( tocList && tocList.length > 0 && tocList[0].childNodes.length > 0 ) {
    document.getElementById( 'article-toc' ).parentNode.classList.remove( 'hidden' );
  }
</script>
----

== Add an Extensions folder below src/class

. Create a folder named `Extensions` below src/css.
. Download the Antora UP project for Across Site docs from https://github.com/ForeachOS/ax-docs-across-site-ui.
. Copy /ax-docs-across-site-ui-master/src/css/extensions/*article-toc.css* to the Extensions folder you created in your UI. There are other files in the Across Extensions directory, but you do not need them.

== Edit site.css

. Edit antora-ui-default/src/css/site.css.
. Append this line to the end of the file:
. Add a blank line after the last line. Gulp will look for that when you pack the file later.
+
[source,html]
----
@import "extensions/article-toc.css";
----

The site.css file in Across imports additional files, but only article-toc.css is required.

== Use Gulp to pack the UI bundle

The UI bundle has changed so you need to pack it. To complete this step, Gulp must be set up per Antora's installation instructions.

. Open a terminal window.
. Change to the directory containing your Antora UI bundle.
. Type `gulp pack`.


== Build the site from your playbook

. Open another terminal window.
. Change to the directory containing your Antora playbook.
. Enter `antora --pull playbook.yml` to build your site, after replacing playbook.yml with the name of your playbook file.
