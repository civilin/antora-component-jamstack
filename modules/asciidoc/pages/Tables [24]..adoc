AsciiDoc provides full-featured table support. This sets it apart from other markup languages.  Here's how to create a simple table with a heading row and column width percentages:

----

[cols="30,70",options="header"]

|===

| Team | Team Members

| PureCloud Doc Team | Clay, Andy, Jeff, Derek, Jordan, Steve

| CIC Doc Team | Everybody else.

|===

----

[cols="30,70",options="header"]

|===

| Team | Team Members

| PureCloud Doc Team | Clay, Andy, Jeff, Derek, Jordan, Steve

| CIC Doc Team | Everybody else.

|===

If a table has many columns, you can _vertically_ organize the information in each row. Give each cell its own line, and leave a blank line between rows.

----

[cols="30,70",options="header"]

| CIC Doc Team

| Everybody else.

As you can see, the vertical arrangement produces the same result. In my opinion, complex tables are easier to maintain when information is stacked vertically.

[cols="30,70",options="header"]

AsciiDoc supports alignment within cells, row and column spans, header rows, footer rows, and many other options not described here. For information about these advanced options, see the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#tables[documentation].

.Tables created from CSV files

You can display an link:feature_matrix.csv[external .CSV file] as a table. This is a special type of `include`.

The _cols_ attribute in this example left aligns the first column, and centers all other columns. Here how the table appears after the data is read:

[cols="<,^,^,^,^,^",format="csv", options="header"]

include::partial$feature_matrix.csv[]

TIP: AsciiDoc's native support of tables makes it possible to single-source complex content into many formats.  Its ability to describe every element found in print makes AsciiDoc applicable to most writing projects.
