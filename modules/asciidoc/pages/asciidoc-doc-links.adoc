= AsciiDoc Documentation

Excellent documentation is available online. A great place to start is link:http://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor.org^]. There you'll find installation instructions and recent documentation.  That site is managed by Dan Allen, who champions AsciiDoc in the open source community.

Stewart Packham, the creator of AsciiDoc, has another great site--link:http://asciidoc.org[asciidoc.org]. Stewart stopped updating his website in 2013 after handing the baton to Dan. His site describes the specification in depth but you should explore asciidoctor.org first.
