[[HID_ADMONITIONS]]
= Admonitions

// steve this topic contains a link that needs to be fixed (see link to admonition block)

NOTE: An admonition paragraph draws the reader's attention to auxiliary information. Its purpose is determined by the label at the beginning of the paragraph.

Admonitions are notes, tips, warnings, or cautions. To create an admonition:

. Type `NOTE`, `TIP`, `IMPORTANT`, `CAUTION`, or `WARNING` in upper case, followed by a colon and space.

.  Then type your message to the reader. If you need more than 1 paragraph, use an <<HID_ADMONITION_BLOCKS, admonition block>> instead.
