= Couchbase Tabs Extension (Non-working) Example
:tabs:

This page shows how to implement tab pages using the tabs-block.js extension at https://github.com/couchbase/docs-site/blob/master/lib/tabs-block.js.

It extends the AsciiDoc syntax to support a tabset. The tabset is created from a definition list enclosed in an example block that is marked with the tabs style.

For instructions, see https://docs.couchbase.com/home/contribute/tabs.html.
